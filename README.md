This project is part of an online course I am currently taking to learn how to use Angular 6 in my C#/.NET projects. I picked this course becasue it was using Angular 6 with .NET Core, and I'm also hoping to pick up some new bits of knowledge about .NET Core while learning Angular 6 at the same time. I also think that learning Angular in the context in which I intend to use it will be more beneficial than learning it in a simpler context, but then needing to learn how to incorporate it into .NET projects separately later. If you are interested in this project and/or course, the course details are as follows:

Learning Site: Udemy
Course Name: Build an App with ASP.NET Core and Angular from Scratch
Instructor: Neil Cummings
Link: [Course Overview](https://www.udemy.com/build-an-app-with-aspnet-core-and-angular-from-scratch/learn/v4/overview)

I have been really enjoying the course, and have already learned quite a lot of useful tidbits, even though I'm still in the beginning phases of the project.

Please feel free to message me if you have any questions! ^_^

Thanks,
